Prob. Knowledge Base:

    Bot is d-steps away from the leak (shortest path through the ship), the probability of receiving a beep is e^(-a*(d-1)),

    P( leak is in cell j ) for each open cell j
    
    For the cell i the bot is in 
    
        P( leak is in cell i ) = 0
    
    For every other cell j
    
        P( leak is in cell j ) = 1 / (# open cells - 1)
        
At any time t:
    We have that time, bot is located at location bot_t <- cell the bot is in at time t


    We can do two things:
    
        - Bot 'listens' for a beep (or a not-beep)
        
            Bot senses and collects DATA in cell i
            
                - DATA = Beep
                
                    P( leak is in cell i | we heard a beep while in cell i ) = 0
                    P( leak is in cell j | we heard a beep while in cell i ) for j != i
                    
                    P( leak is in cell j | we heard a beep while in cell i )
                    
                        = P( leak is in cell j AND beep in cell i ) / P( beep in cell i )
                        
                        = P( leak in cell j ) * P( beep in cell i | leak in cell j ) / P( beep in cell i )
                        
                        = P( leak in cell j ) * e^(-a*(d(i,j)-1)) / P( beep in cell i )
                        
                        = P( leak in cell j ) * e^(-a*(d(i,j)-1)) / [ sum_k P( leak in k ) *  e^(-a*(d(i,k)-1)) ]
                        
                        
                                P( beep in cell i ) = sum_k P( leak in k AND beep in cell i )
                                
                                = sum_k P( leak in k ) * P( beep in i | leak in k )
                                
                                = sum_k P( leak in k ) *  e^(-a*(d(i,k)-1))
                
                - DATA = No Beep
                
                    Currently:
                    
                        P( leak is in cell k ) for each cell k

        - Bot can move to another cell
        
            Bot moves from cell bot_t to cell i
            
                - Bot finds the leak in cell i
